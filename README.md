This repository have codes regarding the website and REST API that are developed for project regarding the subject. The features that are available in the website are: 
<br/>i. Login
<br/>ii. Register
<br/>iii. User profile
<br/>iv. Home
<br/>v. Listing according to Book Genre 
<br/>vi. Book search with book name, ISBN and author
<br/>vii. Book details
<br/>viii. Shopping cart 
<br/>ix. Purchase (simple purchase that does not include calculation)

REST API are not fully implemented into the SPA, only `read` are implemented to users. `Read` API function is not implemented to books due to having image stored as blob data, and extra steps are required in order to display blob data fetched from the API itself, hence not implemented due to time constraint.
